# zoomautomation
automates the process of joining the meeting, all you need to do is to enter meeting id and password and sit back and relax. You can make required changes to read the meeting id and password from file for multiple meetings. I created this to avoid the hustle of joinig my online classes daily for multiple times a day during COVID-19 outbreak.

this code is optimized for ubuntu users:
for installing the dependencies use command:

pip install -r requirements.txt      (for python2)
pip3 install -r requirements.txt     (for python3)

apart from pyautogui in linux you also need to install scrot by following command:
sudo apt-get install scrot

or else you can also use following command to install pyautogui on:

Linux:
python3 -m pip install pyautogui

apart from pyautogui in linux you also need to install scrot by following command:
sudo apt-get install scrot

macOS
On macOS and Linux, you need to run python3:

python3 -m pip install pyautogui

Windows
On Windows, you can use the py.exe program to run the latest version of Python:

py -m pip install pyautogui
If you have multiply versions of Python installed, you can select which one with a command line argument to py. For example, for Python 3.8, run:

py -3.8 -m pip install pyautogui
(This is the same as running pip install pyautogui.)

Finally to run the code, type the following command:
python3 zoomautomation.py
